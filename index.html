      <h1> Welcome to Mindful Eating! </h1>
      <h2> <em> Mindful eating </em> (i.e., paying attention to our food, on purpose, moment by moment, without judgment) is an approach to food that focuses on individuals' sensual awareness of the food and their experience of the food. </h2>

      <h4> <em> Instructions for practicing mindful eating:) : </em> </h4>
      <ol> 
        <li> Start by taking a few deep breaths and considering the health value of each different piece of food. </li>
        <li> Employ all your senses while you’re shopping, cooking, serving, and eating your food. </li>
        <li> Be curious and make observations about yourself, as well as the food you’re about to eat. </li>
        <li> Tune into your hunger. </li>
        <li> With the food in front of you, take a moment to appreciate it—and any people you’re sharing the meal with—before eating. </li>
        <li> Take a bite, and notice how it feels in your mouth. </li>
        <li> Focus on how your experience shifts moment to moment. </li>
        <li> Put your utensils down between bites. </li>
        <li> Give gratitude and reflect on where this food came from, the plants or animals involved, and all the people it took to transport the food and bring it onto your plate. </li>
        <li> Continue to eat slowly as you talk with your dining companions, paying close attention to your body’s signals of fullness. </li>
      </ol>
